"""Logging system using minimal loguru stub.

This helper sets up loguru so that the application writes log messages to a
rotating file.  Even though the bundled :mod:`loguru` implementation is a very
small stub, it honours the ``add`` options we pass in, making it possible to
describe our intent for the real dependency used in production.
